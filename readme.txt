A CRNN model that autonomously maps gas generation reaction pathways in lithium-ion battery thermal runaway. The resulting mechanism can accurately predicts key parameters, including gas generation rates and amounts, during thermal runaway. This methodology addresses the current limitations in thermal runaway gas prediction, providing a robust framework for enhancing battery.
